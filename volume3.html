              Anubis was the Egyptian deity of cemeteries and embalming as well
              as the protector of graves. As with any other culture or religion
              around the world, the Egyptians believed in paying respect to
              their dead. They conducted elaborate ceremonies and mummification
              processes to help the deceased pass smoothly into the Afterlife.
              Anubis was the deity who played an important role in this journey.
              Depicted with the black head of a jackal, Anubis helped mummify
              Egyptians when they died. Black represented the fertile soil of
              the Nile that was needed to grow yearly crops, so the Egyptians
              believed that the colour black symbolized good fortune and
              rebirth. Anubis would stand in the Hall of the Two Truths and
              weigh the hearts of people seeking judgment.
