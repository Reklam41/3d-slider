              Sekhmet name means “She who is powerful” or “the One who loves
              Ma’at” was the goddess of the hot desert sun, plague, chaos, war,
              and healing. She was created from the fire of the sun god Ra’s eye
              when he looked upon Earth. Ra created her as a weapon to destroy
              humans for their disobedience to him and for not living in
              accordance with the principles of Ma’at. Sometimes she is seen as
              the daughter of Geb (earth), and Nut (the sky). Sekhmet was
              depicted with the body of a woman with a lion head wearing a sun
              disk. She was seen as the protector of the pharaohs and led them
              in warfare. When she was in a calmer state she would take the form
              of the household cat goddess Bastet. Sekhmet was a terrifying
              goddess, however for her friends she could avert plague and cure
              disease. She was the patron of physicians and healers.
